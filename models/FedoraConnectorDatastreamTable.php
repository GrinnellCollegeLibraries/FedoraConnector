/**
 * FedoraConnector Omeka plugin allows users to reuse content managed in
 * institutional repositories in their Omeka repositories.
 *
 * The FedoraConnector plugin provides methods to generate calls against Fedora-
 * based content disemminators. Unlike traditional ingestion techniques, this
 * plugin provides a facade to Fedora-Commons repositories and records pointers
 * to the "real" objects rather than creating new physical copies. This will
 * help ensure longer-term durability of the content streams, as well as allow
 * you to pull from multiple institutions with open Fedora-Commons
 * respositories.
 *
 * PHP version 5
